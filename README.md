# Object-Detection
This project deals with real time analysis to classify the object accurately based on the object detected by the webcam.
The idea was to train the program on different dataset so that it can detect most of the object. 
Since the idea was to detect the object on real time was really challenging. We found YOLO fits best for the real time detection of the object. 
It detects the object and classify the object and predicts the object with the accuracy of the object i.e., confidence.
YOLO can be implemented use many APIs like OpenCV, Darknet, TensorFlow., but in our case we have preferred TensorFlow Object Detection as Primary.

Worked on the CIFAR 10 dataset. The aim was to use the algorithm that works best to train the dataset and improve the classification performance.
Our tasks briefly use VGG algorithm that deals with noisy levels and gives best accuracy by increasing the number of convolution layers. 
We used keras library for the accomplishing the task.
